# Laravel Rector

Opinionated Rector Rules for Laravel

## Requirements

- PHP `^8.5`
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 13

## Installation

```bash
composer require zero-to-prod/laravel-rector
```

### Configuration

CLI install. It asks for every value the package can be configured with and
writes `config/laravel-rector.php`:

```bash
php artisan laravel-rector:install
```

Rerunning it is safe: the file reports `created`, `unchanged` or `updated`, and
is only overwritten once you confirm.

To publish the configuration file by itself instead:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-rector-config
```

## Agent development

The package registers an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so
coding agents can read how it is meant to be used. It requires
[`laravel/mcp`](https://github.com/laravel/mcp), and registers nothing without
it.

```bash
composer require --dev laravel/mcp
php artisan mcp:start laravel-rector
```

Register it with your agent:

```bash
claude mcp add laravel-rector -- php artisan mcp:start laravel-rector
```

Three tools are exposed:

- `readme` — this document.
- `api` — the exact signature of every public class, property and method.
  Anything unlisted is internal and may change in any release.
- `install` — what `laravel-rector:install` does, without a prompt to answer.
  Takes `enabled` and `handle`, each defaulting to the current setting, and
  writes `config/laravel-rector.php`. A file that already says something else
  is left alone and reported until the call passes `overwrite: true`.

Point the handle somewhere else, or turn the server off, in
`config/laravel-rector.php`:

```php
'mcp' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'handle' => 'laravel-rector',
],
```

## Development

```bash
composer check   # lint, rector, phpstan, 100% coverage, bc-check — mutates nothing
composer fix     # rector then pint
composer mcp list                      # the server's tools
composer mcp call api '{}'             # call one
```

`composer check` requires a coverage driver (Xdebug or pcov); without one Pest
cannot satisfy the `--min=100` gate.
